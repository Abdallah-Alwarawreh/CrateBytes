## Start Session

The `Start Session` endpoint is used to initiate a new game session for a player. This is essential for tracking player activity and engagement within the game. When a session is started, it allows the game to monitor the player's playtime.

### Endpoint

```http
POST /api/game/session/start
```

<ParamField header="authorization (header)" type="string" required>
    Bearer [token]
</ParamField>

### Example Response

```json
Session Started
```

```json
Session already active
```

## Heartbeat

The `Heartbeat` endpoint is used to keep an active game session alive. This is crucial for ensuring that the session does not expire due to inactivity. By sending periodic heartbeat requests, the game can maintain the session's active state and continue tracking the player's playtime. **A session will end after 10 minutes of inactivity, so it is recommended to send a heartbeat every 5 minutes.**

### Endpoint

```http
POST /api/game/session/heartbeat
```

<ParamField header="authorization (header)" type="string" required>
    Bearer [token]
</ParamField>

### Example Response

```json
Heartbeat updated
```

```json
No active session found
```

```json
Session has expired
```

## End Session

The `End Session` endpoint is used to terminate an active game session for a player. This is important for accurately tracking the total playtime of the player. When a session is ended, it stops the tracking of the player's playtime and finalizes the session data.

### Endpoint

```http
POST /api/game/session/end
```

<ParamField header="authorization (header)" type="string" required>
    Bearer [token]
</ParamField>

### Example Response

```json
Session ended successfully
```

```json
No active session found
```
